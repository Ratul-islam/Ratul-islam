> *MERN stack developer stuck in JavaScript hell*

## The Situation
I build websites with JavaScript. My therapist says this is progress. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Computer Science student who learned CSS the hard way, then discovered Tailwind and questioned everything. Currently debugging React components while pretending I understand how Next.js actually works.

## Technologies I Wrestle With Daily
```javascript
// Yes, I'm writing my skills in the language I complain about
const ratul = {
  frontend: ["React", "Next.js", "HTML", "CSS", "Tailwind CSS"],
  backend: ["Node.js", "Express", "Flask", "FastAPI"],
  databases: ["MongoDB", "PostgreSQL", "MySQL"],
  languages: ["JavaScript", "TypeScript", "Python"],
  ai_stuff: ["OpenAI API", "Vector DBs"],
  debugging_method: "console.log() until something works"
};
```

## Projects That Somehow Work
- **[100VP Login](https://login.100vp.com)** - Authentication that doesn't make users cry
- **[ClickHunts](https://clickhunts.com)** - Click hunting simulator (better than it sounds)
- **[AI Proctor](https://aiproctor.daffodilglobal.ai)** - AI watches you code and judges silently

*And approximately 73 unfinished projects in various states of decay*

## My Relationship With JavaScript
- **Week 1**: "JavaScript is weird but manageable"
- **Week 52**: "Why does `[] + [] = ''` but `[] + {} = '[object Object]'`?"
- **Week 104**: *Acceptance stage*
- **Current**: Building React apps while internally screaming

## Daily Tech Struggles
- **Tailwind**: "I'll never remember all these classes"
- **Also me**: `className="flex items-center justify-center h-screen bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-600"`
- **Next.js**: "It's just React with extra steps"
- **PostgreSQL**: "Why did I choose a database that's harder to spell than MongoDB?"

## The Stack Overflow Chronicles
```bash
# My browser bookmarks:
- "React useEffect infinite loop fix"
- "Next.js deployment issues 2024"
- "Tailwind CSS not working"
- "PostgreSQL connection refused"
- "JavaScript why is this undefined"
- "How to exit vim" (just in case)
```

## Find Me Online

## Current Mood
```javascript
const currentStatus = async () => {
  while (bugs.exist()) {
    await drink.coffee();
    console.log("This should work...");
    // Narrator: It did not work
  }
};
```

Currently available for:
- React/Next.js projects
- Tailwind CSS therapy sessions
- Explaining why my PostgreSQL query returns undefined
- Existential discussions about JavaScript

**Status**: Building responsive layouts with Tailwind while Next.js builds take forever ‚è≥
